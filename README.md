# DSA Practice

I’m tackling one DSA problem every day, starting April 2025. Each day’s folder includes:

- `problem-statement.md`: Full problem description + link to source.  
- `brute_force.*`: My first (usually O(n²) or naive) solution.  
- `optimized.*`: The improved version—often using hashing, two‑pointers, DP, etc.
